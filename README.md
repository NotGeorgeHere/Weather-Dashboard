Could improve it with some functions to reduce the repitiveness of code maybe for the future

Future improvement could be creating toggles for which information you want to see

Button to clear previous searches and only a limit on how many searches before it pushes off the last value and pops on the new value and also a feature that stops the same thing being searched every time ie London, london, london, london to give it some variety
